# Sudoku_Java
Rewrite of code in processing but better

So... it's a sudoku solver. It uses logic for the simpler sudoku puzzles, but for more complex ones, it'll use a recursive solver. Nice.
It can directly write to input.txt or output.txt files, or it can directly input the data into sudoku websites (e.g. sudoku.com) - you just need to input the top left coordinate of the input box, the width and the height of the input box, plus the delay when you alt-tab.
