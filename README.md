# Sudoku_Java
Sïœ‚o... it's a sudoku solver. It uses logic for the simpler sudoku puzzles, but for more complex ones, it'll fallback to a recursive solver.
It can directly write to input.txt or output.txt files, or it can directly input the data into sudoku websites (e.g. sudoku.com) - you just need to input the top left coordinate of the input box, the width and the height of the input box, plus the delay when you switch tabs/windows to access it.
